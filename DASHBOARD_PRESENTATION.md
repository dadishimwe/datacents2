## 📝 Presentation Transcript

### **Opening (10 seconds)**
*"Welcome to the DataCents Default Risk Dashboard. This is a real-time machine learning system that assesses loan default risk in peer-to-peer lending markets using our proprietary XGBoost model trained on 2.2 million loan records."*

### **Live Demo Walkthrough (40 seconds)**

#### **Step 1: Input Panel (10 seconds)**
*"Here, users input loan details: amount, interest rate, credit score, and borrower information. Watch as I adjust the loan amount from $50,000 to $75,000..."*

**Action:** Move loan amount slider from 50k to 75k
*"Notice how the risk score immediately updates from 0.28 to 0.42. This happens because our model processes these inputs through 150+ engineered features in real-time."*

#### **Step 2: Risk Assessment (10 seconds)**
*"The dashboard provides three key outputs: a risk score, confidence level, and prediction interval. This risk score of 0.42 means a 42% probability of default. The confidence level of 87% indicates our model's certainty in this prediction."*

**Action:** Point to the gauge and confidence metrics
*"The prediction interval shows the range where the true risk likely falls - between 37% and 47%."*

#### **Step 3: Key Influencers (10 seconds)**
*"The system identifies the top factors driving this risk assessment. Here, we see that the high DTI ratio of 0.45 is the primary concern, followed by the credit score of 680. This transparency helps users understand the decision-making process."*

**Action:** Scroll to Key Influencers section

#### **Step 4: Advanced Analytics (10 seconds)**
*"In the Advanced Analytics tab, users can explore feature importance, historical comparisons, and scenario modeling. This borrower is in the 65th percentile compared to our database, and our scenario analysis shows how different conditions would affect their risk profile."*

**Action:** Switch to Advanced Analytics tab, show feature importance bars

### **Closing (10 seconds)**
*"This dashboard transforms complex machine learning into actionable insights. It's currently processing live data and can handle thousands of assessments daily. The system learns and improves with each prediction, making it an invaluable tool for any lending platform looking to reduce default rates and increase investor confidence."*
